# Optional: Record configuration
# NOTE: Can be overridden at the camera level
record:
  # Optional: Enable recording (default: shown below)
  # WARNING: If recording is disabled in the config, turning it on via
  #          the UI or MQTT later will have no effect.
  # WARNING: Frigate does not currently support limiting recordings based
  #          on available disk space automatically. If using recordings,
  #          you must specify retention settings for a number of days that
  #          will fit within the available disk space of your drive or Frigate
  #          will crash.

  # Optional: Number of minutes to wait between cleanup runs (default: shown below)

  retain:
    # Optional: Number of days to retain recordings regardless of events (default: shown below)

    days: 3
    # Optional: Mode for retention. Available options are: all, motion, and active_objects
    #   all - save all recording segments regardless of activity
    #   motion - save all recordings segments with any detected motion
    #   active_objects - save all recording segments with active/moving objects
    # NOTE: this mode only applies when the days setting above is greater than 0

# Optional: Live stream configuration for WebUI
# NOTE: Can be overridden at the camera level
live:
  # Optional: Set the height of the live stream. (default: 720)
  # This must be less than or equal to the height of the detect stream. Lower resolutions
  # reduce bandwidth required for viewing the live stream. Width is computed to match known aspect ratio.
  height: 720
  # Optional: Set the encode quality of the live stream (default: shown below)
  # 1 is the highest quality, and 31 is the lowest. Lower quality feeds utilize less CPU resources.
